## About GX OSS

With GX OSS, you can assert what you expect from the data you load and transform, and catch data issues quickly – Expectations are unit tests for your data. Not only that, but GX OSS also creates data documentation and data quality reports from those Expectations. Data science and data engineering teams use GX OSS to:

- Test data they ingest from other teams or vendors and ensure its validity.
- Validate data they transform as a step in their data pipeline to ensure the correctness of transformations.
- Prevent data quality issues from slipping into data products.
- Streamline knowledge capture from subject-matter experts and make implicit knowledge explicit.
- Develop rich, shared documentation of their data.

To learn more about how data teams are using GX OSS, see [Case studies from Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/case-studies/).

See [Down with Pipeline Debt!](https://greatexpectations.io/blog/down-with-pipeline-debt-introducing-great-expectations/) for an introduction to our pipeline data quality testing philosophy.

## Our upcoming 1.0 release

We’re planning a ton of work to take GX OSS to the next level as we move to 1.0!

Our biggest goal is to improve the user and contributor experiences by **streamlining the API**, based on the feedback we’ve received from the community (thank you!) over the years.

Learn more about our plans for 1.0 and how we’ll be making this transition in our [blog post](https://greatexpectations.io/blog/the-next-step-for-gx-oss-1-0).

## Get started

 Run the following command in an empty base directory inside a Python virtual environment to install GX OSS:

    ```bash title="Terminal input"
    pip install great_expectations
    ```

For more information about getting started with GX OSS, see [Get started with Great Expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/oss/guides/setup/get_started_lp).

## Get support

- Chat with community members about general issues and seek solutions on the [GX Slack community channel](https://greatexpectationstalk.slack.com/archives/CUTCNHN82).

- If you've found a bug, open an issue in one of the [GX GitHub repositories](https://github.com/great-expectations).

## Contribute

We deeply value the contributions and engagement of our community. We’re temporarily pausing the acceptance of new pull requests (PRs). We’re going to be updating the API and codebase frequently and significantly over the next few months—we don’t want contributors to spend time and effort only to find that we’ve just implemented a breaking change for their work.

Hold onto your fantastic ideas and PRs until after the 1.0 release, when we will be excited to resume accepting them. We appreciate your understanding and support as we make this final push toward this exciting milestone. Watch for updates in our [Slack](https://greatexpectations.io/slack) community, and thank you for being a crucial part of our journey!

## Code of conduct

Everyone interacting in GX OSS project codebases, Discourse forums, Slack channels, and email communications is expected to adhere to the [GX Community Code of Conduct](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/t/gx-community-code-of-conduct/1199).
