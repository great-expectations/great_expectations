# This config file supports variable substitution which enables: 1) keeping
# secrets out of source control & 2) environment-based configuration changes
# such as staging vs prod.
#
# When GX encounters substitution syntax (like `my_key: ${my_value}` or
# `my_key: $my_value`) in the config file it will attempt to replace the value
# of `my_key` with the value from an environment variable `my_value` or a
# corresponding key read from the file specified using
# `config_variables_file_path`. Environment variables take precedence.
#
# If the substitution value comes from the config variables file, it can be a
# simple (non-nested) value or a nested value such as a dictionary. If it comes
# from an environment variable, it must be a simple value. Read more at:
