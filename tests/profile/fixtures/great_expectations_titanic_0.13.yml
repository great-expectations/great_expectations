# Welcome to Great Expectations! Always know what to expect from your data.

# Here you can define datasources, batch kwargs generators, integrations and
# more. This file is intended to be committed to your repo. For help with
# configuration please:
#   - Read our docs: https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/reference/spare_parts/data_context_reference.html#configuration

# config_version refers to the syntactic version of this config file, and is used in maintaining backwards compatibility
# It is auto-generated and usually does not need to be changed.
config_version: 3

# Datasources tell Great Expectations where your data lives and how to get it.
# You can use the CLI command `great_expectations datasource new` to help you
# add a new datasource. Read more at https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/reference/core_concepts/datasource.html

stores:
  # Stores are configurable places to store things like Expectations, Validations
  # Data Docs, and more. These are for advanced users only - most users can simply
  # leave this section alone.
  #
  # Three stores are required: expectations, validations, and
  # suite_parameters, and must exist with a valid store entry. Additional
  # stores can be configured for uses such as data_docs, validation_operators, etc.
