# Welcome to great expectations. 
# This project configuration file allows you to define datasources, 
# generators, integrations, and other configuration artifacts that
# make it easier to use Great Expectations.

# For more help configuring great expectations, 
# see the documentation at: https://greatexpectations.io/config_file.html

# NOTE: GE uses the names of configured datasources and generators to manage
# how expectations and other configuration artifacts are stored in the 
# expectations/ and datasources/ folders. If you need to rename an existing
# datasource or generator, be sure to also update the paths for related artifacts.
