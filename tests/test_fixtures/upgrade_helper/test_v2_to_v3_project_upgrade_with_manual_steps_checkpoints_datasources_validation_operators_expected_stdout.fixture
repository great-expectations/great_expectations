|| UpgradeHelperV13: Upgrade Overview ||
++====================================++

UpgradeHelperV13 will upgrade your project to be compatible with Great Expectations V3 API.

**WARNING**: Before proceeding, please make sure you have appropriate backups of your project.

Automated Steps
================

The following Stores and/or Store Names will be upgraded:

    - Stores: checkpoint_store
    - Store Names: checkpoint_store_name

Manual Steps
=============

The following Checkpoints must be upgraded manually, due to using the old Checkpoint format, which is being deprecated:

    - Checkpoints: my_checkpoint, titanic_checkpoint_0, titanic_checkpoint_1, titanic_checkpoint_2

The following Data Sources must be upgraded manually, due to using the old Datasource format, which is being deprecated:

    - Data Sources: dataset_diabetes__dir

Your configuration uses validation_operators, which are being deprecated.  Please, manually convert validation_operators to use the new Checkpoint validation unit, since validation_operators will be deleted.
