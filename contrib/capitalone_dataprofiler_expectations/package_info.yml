# The purpose of this file is to allow you to add relevant pieces of metadata
# to your package before it is uploaded to the Expectation Gallery.
#
# While most of the information about the data is parsed through the `great_expectations_contrib`
# CLI, this file allows you to configure particular settings like images and individuals.
#
# The three primary sections of the file are:
#   1. general:        High-level, miscellaneous details about the package
#   2. code_owners:    The individuals responsible for the package
#   3. domain_experts: Any individual with highly specialized knowledge of the given domain
#
# For an example of a valid package_info.yml configuration, please visit the contributing section

  description: Data Profiler is an [open source solution](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/open-source/) from Capital One that uses [machine learning](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/)
    to help companies monitor big data and detect private customer information so that it can be protected. [Data Profiler](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/open-source/basics-of-data-profiler/)
    provides a pre-trained deep learning model to efficiently identify sensitive information, components to conduct statistical analysis of the dataset, and an API to build data labelers.
    Data Profiler can accept a wide range of data formats including csv, avro, parquet, json, text, and pandas DataFrames.
    Whether the data is structured, semi-structured or unstructured, the library is able to identify the schema, statistics, entities from the data.
    Versatility of the data labeler allows models to be modified as needed and it’s possible to run multiple models on the same dataset with just a few lines of code.
