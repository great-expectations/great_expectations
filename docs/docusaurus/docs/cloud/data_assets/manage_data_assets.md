A Data Asset is a collection of records that you create when you connect to your Data Source. When you connect to your Data Source, you define a minimum of one Data Asset. You use these Data Assets to create the Batch Requests that select the data that is provided to your Expectations.

<!-- [//]: # (TODO: To learn more about Data Assets, see Data Asset.) -->


## Create a Data Asset

Create a Data Asset to define the data you want GX Cloud to access. To connect to Data Assets for a Data Source not currently available in GX Cloud, see [Connect to data](/core/connect_to_data/connect_to_data.md) in the GX Core documentation.

2. Edit the following fields:

    - **Table name**: Enter a new name for the Data Asset table.

    - **Data Asset name**: Enter a new name for the Data Asset. If you use the same name for multiple Data Assets, each Data Asset must be associated with a unique Data Source.

3. Click **Save**.

## Data Source credential management

To connect to your Data Source in GX Cloud, there are two methods for managing credentials:

1. **Direct input**: You can input credentials directly into GX Cloud. These credentials are stored in GX Cloud and securely encrypted at rest and in transit. When Data Source credentials have been directly provided, they can be used to connect to a Data Source in any GX Cloud deployment pattern.

2. **Environment variable substitution**: To enhance security, you can use environment variables to manage sensitive connection parameters or strings. For example, instead of directly including your database password in configuration settings, you can use a variable reference like `${MY_DATABASE_PASSWORD}`. When using environment variable substitution, your password is not stored or transmitted to GX Cloud.

:::warning[Environment variable substitution support]
Environment variable substitution is not supported in fully hosted deployments.
:::

   - **Configure the environment variable**: Enter the name of your environment variable, enclosed in `${}`, into the Data Source setup form. For instance, you might use `${MY_DATABASE_PASSWORD}`.

   - **Inject the variable into your GX Agent container or environment**: When running the GX Agent Docker container, include the environment variable in the command. For example:
   
 ```bash title="Terminal input"
   docker run -it -e MY_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD> -e GX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> -e GX_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID=<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID> greatexpectations/agent:stable
 ```

When running the GX Agent in other Docker-based service, including Kubernetes, ECS, ACI, and GCE, use the service's instructions to set and provide environment variables to the running container.

When using environment variable substitution in a read-only deployment, set the environment variable in the environment where the GX Core Python client is running.

## Delete a Data Asset

1. In GX Cloud, click **Settings** > **Datasources**.

2. Click **Delete** for the Data Source and the associated Data Assets you want to delete.
