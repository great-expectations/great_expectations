The `class_name` and `module_name` for your Data Source will almost always indicate the `Data Source` class found at `great_expectations.datasource`.  You may replace this with a specialized subclass, or a custom class, but for almost all regular purposes these two default values will suffice.  For the purposes of this guide, add those two values to their corresponding keys.

```python name="datasource_configuration_class_and_module_keys"
```

Your full configuration should now look like:

```python name="datasource_configuration_post_class_and_module_keys"
```
