You can verify that your Stores are properly configured by running the command:

```bash title="Terminal command"
great_expectations store list
```

This will list the currently configured Stores that Great Expectations has access to.  If you added a new S3 Expectations Store, the output should include the following `ExpectationsStore` entry:

```bash title="Terminal output"
- name: expectations_S3_store
class_name: ExpectationsStore
store_backend:
  class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
  bucket: '<your_s3_bucket_name>'
  prefix: '<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```

Notice the output contains only one Expectation Store: your configuration contains the original ``expectations_store`` on the local filesystem and the ``expectations_S3_store`` we just configured, but the `great_expectations store list` command only lists your active stores.  For your Expectation Store, this is the one that you set as the value of the ``expectations_store_name`` variable in the configuration file: ``expectations_S3_store``.
