Run the following code to verify that your Stores are properly configured:

```bash title="Terminal command"
great_expectations store list
```

A list of configured Stores that Great Expectations can access appears.  If you added a new S3 Expectations Store, the output should include the following `ExpectationsStore` entry:

```bash title="Terminal output"
- name: expectations_S3_store
class_name: ExpectationsStore
store_backend:
  class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
  bucket: '<your_s3_bucket_name>'
  prefix: '<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```

Only one Expectation Store is listed. Your configuration contains the original ``expectations_store`` on the local filesystem and the ``expectations_S3_store`` you configured, but the `great_expectations store list` command only lists your active stores.  For your Expectation Store, this is the one that you set as the value of the ``expectations_store_name`` variable in the ``expectations_S3_store`` configuration file.
