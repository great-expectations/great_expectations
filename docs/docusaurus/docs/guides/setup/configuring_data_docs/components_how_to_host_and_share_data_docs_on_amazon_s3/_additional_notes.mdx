- Optionally, you may wish to update static hosting settings for your bucket to enable AWS to automatically serve your
index.html file or a custom error file:

  ```bash
  > aws s3 website s3://data-docs.my_org/ --index-document index.html
  ```


- If you wish to host a Data Docs site in a subfolder of an S3 bucket, add the ``prefix`` property to the configuration snippet in step 4, immediately after the ``bucket`` property.

- If you wish to host a Data Docs site through a private DNS, you can configure a ``base_public_path`` for the <TechnicalTag relative="../../../../" tag="data_docs_store" text="Data Docs Store" />.  The following example will configure a S3 site with the ``base_public_path`` set to ``www.mydns.com``.  Data Docs will still be written to the configured location on S3 (for example ``https://s3.amazonaws.com/data-docs.my_org/docs/index.html``), but you will be able to access the pages from your DNS (``http://www.mydns.com/index.html`` in our example)

  ```yaml
  data_docs_sites:
    s3_site:  # this is a user-selected name - you may select your own
      class_name: SiteBuilder
      store_backend:
        class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
        bucket: data-docs.my_org  # UPDATE the bucket name here to match the bucket you configured above.
        base_public_path: http://www.mydns.com
      site_index_builder:
        class_name: DefaultSiteIndexBuilder
        show_cta_footer: true
   ```
