Once Great Expectations finishes executing your `great_expectations init` command, verifying that your Data Context was created is as simple as checking the contents of the folder that you ran the `init` command from.

After running the `init` command, your `great_expectations` directory will contain all of the important components of a local Great Expectations deployment. This is what the directory structure looks like:

- `great_expectations.yml` contains the main configuration of your deployment.
- The `expectations` directory stores all your <TechnicalTag relative="../../" tag="expectation" text="Expectations" /> as JSON files. If you want to store them somewhere else, you can change that later.
- The `plugins/` directory holds code for any custom plugins you develop as part of your deployment.
- The `uncommitted/` directory contains files that shouldn’t live in version control. It has a .gitignore configured to exclude all its contents from version control. The main contents of the directory are:
  - `uncommitted/config_variables.yml`, which holds sensitive information, such as database credentials and other secrets.
  - `uncommitted/data_docs`, which contains Data Docs generated from Expectations, Validation Results, and other metadata.
  - `uncommitted/validations`, which holds Validation Results generated by Great Expectations.
