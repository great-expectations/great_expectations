ZenML is an extensible, open-source framework for creating production-ready, portable machine learning (ML) pipelines.  Integrating Great Expectations (GX) with ZenML helps data scientists and ML engineers to make data profiling and validation an integral part of their
production ML toolset and workflows.

To use GX with ZenML, see [Integrating ZenML with Great Expectations](/docs/0.15.50/integrations/integration_zenml) in version 0.15.50 of the documentation.
