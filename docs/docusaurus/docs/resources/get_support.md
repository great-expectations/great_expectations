Knowing how and where to request GX support can improve response times.

## GX Cloud support

Use one of the following methods to request support:

- Send an email to support@greatexpectations.io.
- Create a new topic on the [GX Cloud Discourse forum](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/cloud-support/17).
- Post a message in the [GX Cloud Slack community channel](https://greatexpectationstalk.slack.com/archives/C051D941XAL).
- Learn how to set up GX Cloud from our team by [Joining a workshop](https://hubs.li/Q02nK_ZH0)
- Get a walkthrough of the product by [requesting a demo](https://greatexpectations.io/demo)

## GX Core support

The order in which we are prioritizing support issues are as follows: 

- Issues and PRs in the [GX GitHub repository](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations)
- Questions posted to the [GX Cloud Discourse forum](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/oss-support/11)
- Questions posted to the [GX Slack community channel](https://greatexpectationstalk.slack.com/archives/CUTCNHN82)

**Your support question will be answered more quickly if you post in Discourse than if you post in Slack.** The reason: Discourse allows for better organization and searchability of support topics.

For specific details on what is GX-supported (in either GX Core or GX Cloud), community-supported or not supported, you can reference our [integration and support policy](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/application_integration_support/). For areas not covered by GX support, we encourage community-driven assistance. Check out the [GX Core Issues Board](https://github.com/orgs/great-expectations/projects/2?pane=info) for the latest status on GitHub Issues. 

## How to effectively get support

The following are some recommendations for resolving issues on your own. Resolving issues on your own builds your knowledge and allows you to share that knowledge with the community.

### Search the GX documentation

Search the docs you're using currently for an answer to your issue or question.

If you're new to GX Cloud, review the [GX Cloud overview](/cloud/overview/gx_cloud_overview.md).

If you're new to GX Core, see the [Introduction to GX Core](/core/introduction/introduction.mdx).

### Include all the relevant information

Clearly explain the issue you're experiencing, or the problem you're trying to solve. When asking questions, you should provide the following:

- The complete error log or logs.

- The relevant code you're trying to run.

- The version of GX Core you're using.

- A detailed explanation of what you're trying to resolve including what attempts you've made on your own to date.
