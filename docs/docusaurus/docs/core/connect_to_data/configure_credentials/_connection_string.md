import ConnectionStringTable from './_connection_string_reference_table.md';

Different types of SQL database have different formats for their connection string.  In the following table, the text in `<>` corresponds to the values specific to your credentials and connection string.

<ConnectionStringTable/>

Other connection string formats are valid provided they are for a SQL database that is supported by SQLAlchemy.  You can find more information on the dialects supported by `SQLAlchemy` on their [dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/index.html) page.
