Great Expectations (GX) is committed to building a great application and a great community.

Often, open source (OSS) applications have a reputation for being unfriendly and unwelcoming. GX wants to break this stereotype and is dedicated to making you feel welcome and a part of its success.


## Ask a question

GX has a [Discourse community forum](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/) that includes categories for [GX Core Support](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/oss-support/) and [GX Cloud Support](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/cloud-support/).
