Great Expectations (GX) is committed to building a great application and a great community.

Often, open source (OSS) applications have a reputation for being unfriendly and unwelcoming. GX wants to break this stereotype and is dedicated to making you feel welcome and a part of its success.


## Ask a question

GX has a [Discourse community forum](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/) that includes categories for [GX OSS Support](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/oss-support/) and [GX Cloud Support](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/cloud-support/). Here you'll find guidance on [what information to provide to get your questions answered quickly](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/t/how-to-get-your-questions-answered/1191).
