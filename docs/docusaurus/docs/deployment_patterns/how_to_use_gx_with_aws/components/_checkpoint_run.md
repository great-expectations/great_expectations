Finally, having added our Checkpoint to our Data Context, we will run the Checkpoint.  Since we did not pre-configure the Checkpoint with a Batch Request and Expectation Suite, we will pass those in as a list item in the parameter `validations`:

```python name="tests/integration/docusaurus/deployment_patterns/databricks_deployment_patterns_dataframe_yaml_configs.py run checkpoint"
```
