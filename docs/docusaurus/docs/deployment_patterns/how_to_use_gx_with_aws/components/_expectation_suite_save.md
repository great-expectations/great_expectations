When you have run all of the Expectations you want for this dataset, you can call `validator.save_expectation_suite()` to save the Expectation Suite (all of the unique Expectation Configurations from each run of `validator.expect_*`)for later use in a Checkpoint.

```python name="tests/integration/docusaurus/deployment_patterns/aws_cloud_storage_pandas.py save_expectations"
```
