Run the following command to verify that the AWS CLI is installed:

```bash title="Terminal command"
aws --version
```

If this command does not return the AWS CLI version information, you may need to install the AWS CLI or troubleshoot your current installation. See [Install or update the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
