When you tested your Datasource, you also created all the components you needed to create Expectations. This includes a Batch Request to provide sample data to test your new Expectations against, an empty Expectation Suite to contain your new Expectations, and a Validator to create those Expectations with.

You can reuse these components.  Alternatively, you can define a new Batch Request, Expectation Suite, and Validator if you want to use a different Batch of data as the reference sample when you are creating Expectations or you want to use a different name for your Expectation Suite.
