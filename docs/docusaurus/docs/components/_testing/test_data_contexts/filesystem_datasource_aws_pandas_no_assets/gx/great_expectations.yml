# Welcome to Great Expectations! Always know what to expect from your data.

# Here you can define datasources, batch kwargs generators, integrations and
# more. This file is intended to be committed to your repo. For help with
# configuration please:

# config_version refers to the syntactic version of this config file, and is used in maintaining backwards compatibility
# It is auto-generated and usually does not need to be changed.
config_version: 4.0

# This config file supports variable substitution which enables: 1) keeping
# secrets out of source control & 2) environment-based configuration changes
# such as staging vs prod.
#
# When GX encounters substitution syntax (like `my_key: ${my_value}` or
# `my_key: $my_value`) in the great_expectations.yml file, it will attempt
# to replace the value of `my_key` with the value from an environment
# variable `my_value` or a corresponding key read from this config file,
# which is defined through the `config_variables_file_path`.
# Environment variables take precedence over variables defined here.
#
# Substitution values defined here can be a simple (non-nested) value,
# nested value such as a dictionary, or an environment variable (i.e. ${ENV_VAR})

stores:
  # Stores are configurable places to store things like Expectations, Validations
  # Data Docs, and more. These are for advanced users only - most users can simply
  # leave this section alone.
  #
  # Three stores are required: expectations, validations, and
  # suite_parameters, and must exist with a valid store entry. Additional
  # stores can be configured for uses such as data_docs, etc.
