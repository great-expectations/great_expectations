:::info executing python commands with `python` or `python3`

Depending on your installation and configuration of Python 3, you may find that executing Python commands from the terminal by calling `python` doesn't work as desired.  If a command using `python` does not work, try using `python3`.

Instead of:

```console title="Terminal command"
python --version
```

Try:

```console title="Terminal command"
python3 --version
```

If this produces the desired result, simply replace `python` with `python3` in our example terminal commands.

If this does not work, you may need to look into your Python 3 installation or configuration.
