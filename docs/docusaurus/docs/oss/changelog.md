### Deprecation policy

GX Core follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200), including its [guidelines for deprecation](https://semver.org/#how-should-i-handle-deprecating-functionality).

When we deprecate our public APIs, we will

- update our documentation to let you know about the change.
- issue a new minor release with the deprecation in place.

Before we completely remove the functionality in a new major release, there will be at least one minor release that contains the deprecation so that you can smoothly transition to the new API.
