Because we are using one of Great Expectation's builtin Data Connectors, an entry for `module_name` along with a default value will be provided when this Data Connector is initialized.

However, if you want to use a custom Data Connector, you will need to explicitly add a `module_name` key alongside the `class_name` key.

The value for `module_name` would then be set as the import path for the module containing your custom Data Connector, in the same fashion as you would provide `class_name` and `module_name` for a custom Data Source or Execution Engine.
