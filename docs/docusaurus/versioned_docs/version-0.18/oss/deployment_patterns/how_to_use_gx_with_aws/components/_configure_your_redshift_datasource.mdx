Creating a Redshift Data Source is as simple as providing the `add_or_update_sql(...)` method a `name` by which to reference it in the future and the `connection_string` with which to access it.

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/aws_redshift_deployment_patterns.py vars"
```

With these two values, we can create our Data Source:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/aws_redshift_deployment_patterns.py datasource"
```
