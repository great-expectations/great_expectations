We use CDN fetch rates to get a sense of total community usage of Great Expectations. Specifically, we host images and style sheets on a public CDN and count the number of unique IPs from which resources are fetched.

Other than standard web request data, we don’t collect any data data that could be used to identify individual users. You can suppress the images by changing ``static_images_dir`` in ``great_expectations/render/view/templates/top_navbar.j2``.

Please reach out `on Slack <https://greatexpectations.io/slack>`__ if you have any questions or comments.
