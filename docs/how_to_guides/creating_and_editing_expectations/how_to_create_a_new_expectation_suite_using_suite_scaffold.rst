How to create a new Expectation Suite using ``suite scaffold``
==============================================================

``great_expectations suite scaffold`` helps you quickly create of :ref:`Expectation Suites` through an interactive development loop that combines :ref:`Profilers` and :ref:`Data Docs`.

.. admonition:: Prerequisites: This how-to guide assumes you have already:

  - :ref:`Set up a working deployment of Great Expectations <getting_started>`

Steps
-----

1. **Run `suite scaffold`**

    .. code-block:: bash

        great_expectations suite scaffold my_suite

    Much like the ``suite new`` and ``suite edit`` commands, you will be prompted interactively to choose some data from one of your datasources.

    .. code-block:: bash

        suite scaffold npi_distributions --no-jupyter
        Heads up! This feature is Experimental. It may change. Please give us your feedback!

        Enter the path (relative or absolute) of a data file
        : npi.csv
        To continue scaffolding this suite, run `jupyter notebook uncommitted/scaffold_npi_distributions.ipynb`

    .. important::

        This command generates a disposable jupyter notebook in your ``great_expectations/uncommitted`` directory. The goal is to save you time by writing boilerplate code for you.

        Because these notebooks can be generated at any time from the expectation suites (stored as JSON) you should **consider the notebook to be a disposable artifact**. You can delete it at any time.

    Once you choose a data asset, the CLI will open up a jupyter notebook.

2. **Within the notebook, choose columns and Expectations to scaffold.**

    Run the first cell in the notebook that loads the data. You don't need to worry about what's happening there.

    The next code cell in the notebook presents you with a list of all the columns found in your selected data. Because the scaffolder is not very smart, you will want to edit this suite to tune the parameters and make any adjustments such as removing :ref:`Expectations` that don't make sense for your use case.

    .. code-block:: python

        included_columns = [
            'crim',
            'zn',
            'indus',
            'chas',
            'nox',
            'rm',
            'age',
            # 'dis',
            'rad',
            # 'tax',
            'ptratio',
            # 'b',
            # 'lstat',
            # 'medv'
        ]

    To select which columns you want to scaffold Expectations on, simply uncomment them to include them.

    .. code-block:: python

        scaffold_config = {
            "included_columns": included_columns,
            # "excluded_columns": [],
            # "included_expectations": [],
            # "excluded_expectations": [],
        }

3. **Generate Data Docs and review the results there**

    Run the next few code cells to see the scaffolded suite in Data Docs.

    You can iterate on included and excluded columns and Expectations to get closer to the Suite you want.

Additional notes
----------------

.. important::

    The Suites generated by the ``scaffold`` command **are not meant to be production suites** - they are scaffolds to build upon.

    Great Expectations will choose which Expectations **might make sense** for a column based on the type and cardinality of the data in each selected column.

    You will definitely want to edit the Suite to hone it after scaffolding.
