# Request a documentation change

If you’ve noticed an issue in the documentation, or have recommendations for improving the content, you can submit your request as a GitHub issue in this repository. To avoid forking the repository, Great Expectations recommends using the GitHub Markdown editor to edit documentation.

1. In the [`docusaurus/docs` folder](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/tree/develop/docs), go to the topic file you want to edit. 

    The topic URL includes the topic file name. For example, the URL for the Great Core overview is https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/core/introduction/gx_overview. The URL indicates the topic is located in the `core/introduction` folder, and it's named `gx_overview`.

2. Click the file and then click **Edit this file**.

3. Add your edits.

4. Optional. Click the **Preview** tab to preview your changes.

5. When you’ve completed your edits, scroll down to the **Propose changes** section and add a meaningful commit message and an explanation of what you changed and why.  To help identify the type of issue you’re submitting, add the [DOCS] identifier to the pull request (PR). For example, [DOCS] Update Version Reference. 

6. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. Accept the default name for the branch, or enter a new one.

7. Click **Propose changes**.

    If this is your first Great Expectations documentation contribution, you'll be prompted to complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Complete the CLA and add `@cla-bot check` as a comment to the pull request (PR) to indicate that you’ve completed it.

8. Wait for the Continuous Integration (CI) checks to complete and then correct any syntax or formatting issues.

    A Great Expectations team member reviews, approves, and merges your PR. Depending on your GitHub notification settings, you'll be notified when there are comments or when your changes are successfully merged.
