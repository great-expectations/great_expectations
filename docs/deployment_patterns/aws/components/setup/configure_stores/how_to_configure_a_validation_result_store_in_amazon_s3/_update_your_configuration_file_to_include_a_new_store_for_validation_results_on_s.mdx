### 3. Update your configuration file to include a new Store for Validation Results on S3
-->
import TechnicalTag from '@site/docs/term_tags/_tag.mdx';

You can manually add a Validation Results Store by adding the configuration below to the `stores` section of your `great_expectations.yml` file:

```yaml title="File contents: great_expectations.yml"
stores:
  validations_S3_store:
      class_name: ValidationsStore
      store_backend:
          class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
          bucket: '<your_s3_bucket_name>'
          prefix: '<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```


To make the Store work with S3, you will need to make some changes from the default ``store_backend`` settings, as has been done in the above example.  The ``class_name`` will be set to ``TupleS3StoreBackend``, ``bucket`` will be set to the address of your S3 bucket, and ``prefix`` will be set to the folder in your S3 bucket where Validation results will be located.

For the example above, note that the new Store's name is set to ``validations_S3_store``.  This can be any name you like, as long as you also update the value of the `validations_store_name` key to match the new Store's name.

```yaml title="File contents: great_expectations.yml"
validations_store_name: validations_S3_store
```

This update to the value of the `validations_store_name` key will tell Great Expectations to use the new Store for Validation Results.



:::caution
If you are also storing <TechnicalTag tag="expectation" text="Expectations" /> in S3 ([How to configure an Expectation store to use Amazon S3](../how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_amazon_s3/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_amazon_s3.md)), or DataDocs in S3 ([How to host and share Data Docs on Amazon S3](../../how_to_host_and_share_data_docs_on_amazon_s3/how_to_host_and_share_data_docs_on_amazon_s3.md)), then please ensure that the ``prefix`` values are disjoint and one is not a substring of the other.
