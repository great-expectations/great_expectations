What is Great Expectations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great Expectations is a python framework for bringing data pipelines and products under test.

Software developers have long known that automated testing is essential for managing complex codebases. Using the concept of :ref:`pipeline_testing`, Great Expectations brings the same discipline, confidence, and acceleration to data science and engineering teams.


Why would I use Great Expectations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get more done with data, faster. Teams use Great Expectations to

* Save time during data cleaning and munging.
* Accelerate ETL and data normalization.
* Streamline analyst-to-engineer handoffs.
* Monitor data quality in production data pipelines and data products.
* Simplify debugging data pipelines if (when) they break.


See :ref:`workflow_advantages` to learn more about how Great Expectations speeds up data teams.
