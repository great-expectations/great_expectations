Step 3: Pipeline integration
=================================

This tutorial covers integrating Great Expectations (GE) into a data pipeline.

We will continue the example we used in the previous section, where we created an expectation suite for the data
asset ``npidata``. That defined what we expect a valid batch of this data to look like.

Once our pipeline is deployed, it will process new batches of this data asset as they arrive. We will use
Great Expectations to validate each batch and ensure it matches our expectations for the relevant component of our
data application. Later in this document we will also cover validation operators, which allow you to provide
more complex logic to accompany validation.

Just before calling the method that does the computation on a new batch, we call Great Expectations' validate method.
If the file does not pass validation, we can decide what to do—stop the pipeline, log a warning, send a notification
or perform some other custom action.

A Great Expectations DataContext describes data assets using a three-part namespace consisting of
**datasource_name**, **generator_name**, and **generator_asset**.

To run validation for a data_asset, we need two additional elements:

* a **batch** to validate; in our case it is a file loaded into a Pandas DataFrame
* an **expectation_suite** to validate against

Get a DataContext object
------------------------

A DataContext represents a Great Expectations project. It organizes storage and access for
expectation suites, datasources, notification settings, and data fixtures.
The DataContext is configured via a yml file stored in a directory called great_expectations.
**The configuration file and managed expectation suites should be stored in version control.**

Obtaining a DataContext object gets us access to these resources after the object reads its
configuration file:

.. code-block:: python

    context = ge.data_context.DataContext()


The DataContext constructor takes an optional parameter specifying the path to the ``great_expectations.yml`` file; by
default it will search in the current directory or relative to known great expectations project filepaths.

To read more, see: :ref:`data_context`.


Set a Run Id
-------------

A ``run_id`` links together validations of different data assets, making it possible to track "runs" of a pipeline and
follow data assets as they are transformed, joined, annotated, enriched, or evaluated. The run id can be any string;
by default, Great Expectations will use an ISO 8601-formatted UTC datetime string.

The Great Expectations DataContext object uses the run id to determine when :ref:`evaluation_parameters` should be
linked between data assets. After each validation completes, the DataContext identifies and stores any validation
results that are referenced by other data asset expectation suites managed by the context. Then, when a batch of data
is validated against one of those expectation suites, *with the same run id*, the context will automatically insert
the relevant parameter from the validation result. For example, if a batch of the ``node_2`` data_asset expects the
number of unique values in its ``id`` column to equal the number of distinct values in the ``id`` column from
``node_1``, we need to provide the same run_id to ensure that parameter can be passed between validations.

See :ref:`data_context_evaluation_parameter_store` for more information.

The default ``run_id`` generated by Great Expectations is built using the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    run_id = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat().replace(":", "") + "Z"


Choose a Data Asset and Expectation Suite
-----------------------------------------

We called our data asset ``npidata`` and created an expectation suite called ``warning``.
When there is no ambiguity, the DataContext will be able to infer the fully-normalized name for our data asset
(``data__dir/default/npidata``) from the generator_asset name that we provided, but we can also specify it completely.
For our validation, we will link all of the parameters and supply them to great_expectations.

Usually, we do not need to obtain an expectation suite without an associated batch of data (see the next section), but
if we do wish to obtain the expectation suite directly, the context makes that easy:

.. code-block:: python

  # This command will normalize the shortened data asset name to the full name "data__dir/default/npidata"
  my_suite = context.get_expectation_suite("npidata", "warning")


Obtain a Batch to Validate
-----------------------------

You can use the same approach to obtain a batch of data as we used in the create expectations notebook.

Further, for many integrations, it is possible to provide a reference to an existing batch of data, such as
a pandas or spark DataFrame. In such cases, the :py:class:`~great_expectations.datasource.generator.in_memory_generator.\
InMemoryGenerator` provides a straightforward mechanism to create a Great Expectations data batch
from existing objects; that leaves management of information about the specific batch to your existing pipeline runner.

We can also use a partition_id help a generator identify a particular batch of data and build all the
required ``batch_kwargs`` from a short name:

.. code-block:: python

  batch_kwargs = context.build_batch_kwargs("npidata", "npidata_pfile_20190902-20190908"))

Finally, we can explicitly build batch kwargs, which can be particularly useful for sqlalchemy datasources:

.. code-block:: python

  my_explicit_batch_kwargs = {
    "query": "select id, date, procedure_code from normalized_codes where date < '2019-07-01'"
  }
  batch = context.get_batch("my_source/my_generator/my_asset", "my_expectations", my_explicit_batch_kwargs)


Validate
---------

Validation evaluates our expectations against the given batch and produces a report that describes observed values and
any places where expectations are not met. To validate the batch of data call the :meth:`~great_expectations.\
data_asset.data_asset.DataAsset.validate` method on the batch of data obtained from the DataContext:

.. code-block:: python

  validation_result = batch.validate(run_id=run_id)


Review Validation Results
----------------------------

As part of an integrated pipeline, we may take specific actions based on the the result of the validation run. See
:ref:`validation_result` for more information about the validation_result result object. A common pattern is
to stop or issue a warning in the code:

.. code-block:: python

  if validation_result["success"]:
    logger.info("This file meets all expectations from a valid batch of {0:s}".format(str(data_asset_name)))
  else:
    logger.warning("This file is not a valid batch of {0:s}".format(str(data_asset_name)))


Validation Operators
--------------------

Validation Operators and Actions make it possible to define collections of tasks together that should be done after a
validation. For example, we might store results (either on a local filesystem, to S3 or GCS), send a slack notification,
and update data documentation. The default configuration performs each of those actions. See the
:ref:`validation_operators_and_actions` for more information.

Below is the default configuration for

.. code-block:: bash

  perform_action_list_operator:
    class_name: ActionListValidationOperator
    action_list:
      - name: store_validation_result
        action:
          class_name: StoreAction
      - name: store_evaluation_params
        action:
          class_name: ExtractAndStoreEvaluationParamsAction
      - name: update_data_docs
        action:
          class_name: UpdateDataDocsAction
      - name: send_slack_notification_on_validation_result
        action:
          class_name: SlackNotificationAction
          # put the actual webhook URL in the uncommitted/config_variables.yml file
          slack_webhook: ${validation_notification_slack_webhook}
          notify_on: all # possible values: "all", "failure", "success"
          renderer:
            module_name: great_expectations.render.renderer.slack_renderer
            class_name: SlackRenderer


Save Validation Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DataContext object provides a configurable ``validations_store`` where GE can store validation_result objects for
subsequent evaluation and review. By default, the DataContext stores results in the
``great_expectations/uncommitted/validations`` directory. To specify a different directory or use a remote store such
as ``s3``, edit stores section of the DataContext configuration object:

.. code-block:: bash

    stores:
      validations_store:
        class_name: ValidationsStore
        store_backend:
          class_name: FixedLengthTupleS3Backend
          bucket: my_bucket
          prefix: my_prefix

Validation results will be stored according to the same hierarchical namespace used to refer to data assets elsewhere
in the context, and will have the run_id prepended:
``base_location/run_id/datasource_name/generator_name/generator_asset/expectation_suite_name.json``.

Removing the result_store section from the configuration object will disable automatically storing validation_result
objects.

Send a Slack Notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last action in the action list of the Validation Operator above sends notifications using a user-provided callback
function based on the validation result.

.. code-block:: bash

  - name: send_slack_notification_on_validation_result
    action:
      class_name: SlackNotificationAction
      # put the actual webhook URL in the uncommitted/config_variables.yml file
      slack_webhook: ${validation_notification_slack_webhook}
      notify_on: all # possible values: "all", "failure", "success"
      renderer:
        module_name: great_expectations.render.renderer.slack_renderer
        class_name: SlackRenderer

GE includes a slack-based notification in the base package. To enable a slack notification for results, simply specify
the slack webhook URL in the uncommitted/config_variables.yml file:

.. code-block:: bash

  validation_notification_slack_webhook: https://slack.com/your_webhook_url

:ref:`validation_operators_and_actions`
