You can manually add an <TechnicalTag tag="expectation_store" text="Expectations Store" /> by adding the configuration shown below into the `stores` section of your `great_expectations.yml` file.

```yaml title="File contents: great_expectations.yml"
stores:
  expectations_S3_store:
      class_name: ExpectationsStore
      store_backend:
          class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
          bucket: '<your_s3_bucket_name>'
          prefix: '<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```

To make the store work with S3 you will need to make some changes to default the ``store_backend`` settings, as has been done in the above example.  The ``class_name`` should be set to ``TupleS3StoreBackend``, ``bucket`` will be set to the address of your S3 bucket, and ``prefix`` will be set to the folder in your S3 bucket where Expectation files will be located.

Additional options are available for a more fine-grained customization of the TupleS3StoreBackend.

```yaml title="File contents: great_expectations.yml"
class_name: ExpectationsStore
store_backend:
  class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
  bucket: '<your_s3_bucket_name>'
  prefix: '<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
  boto3_options:
    endpoint_url: ${S3_ENDPOINT} # Uses the S3_ENDPOINT environment variable to determine which endpoint to use.
    region_name: '<your_aws_region_name>'
```

For the above example, please also note that the new Store's name is set to ``expectations_S3_store``.  This value  can be any name you like as long as you also update the value of the `expectations_store_name` key to match the new Store's name.

```yaml title="File contents: great_expectations.yml"
expectations_store_name: expectations_S3_store
```

This update to the value of the `expectations_store_name` key will tell Great Expectations to use the new Store for Expectations.
